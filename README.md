                                                          Front-End Development Project
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         
The Front-End Development Project concentrates on creating web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is an individual project-based course intended to enhance hands-on learning and problem-solving capabilities in the field of front-end web development.

Throughout the course, you will be working on a series of problem statements related to front-end development, with each problem statement building upon the previous one. Hands-on sessions will guide you through sample solutions, helping you to understand the approach to solving these challenges.

Based on your learning in these sessions, you will be required to write the code to solve the assigned problem and submit a report along with the code. This process will be repeated for each subsequent problem statement.

At the end of the course, after submitting the final report, you will be required to appear for a viva examination related to the last problem statement.

Since this is a project-based course, there will be no end-semester examination. Instead, your grades will be determined based on the following:

* Viva performance
* Reports submitted for each problem statement
  
This course is structured to provide a practical, application-driven learning experience in front-end development, ensuring a strong foundation in web technologies.
