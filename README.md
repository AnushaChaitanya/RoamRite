The front-end development project involves the development of web applications with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is an individual project.
In this course, you will be exposed to a set of problem statements related to front end web development. These problem statements will build upon each other. You will be taken through a sample solution to each problem statement, in a hands-on session.

Based upon your learning in the session, you will have to write the code to solve your given problem and submit a report along with the code. This will be repeated for the next problem statement, and so on.

There will be a final viva after the submission of the report related to the last problem statement.

As this is a project course, there will be no end semester exam for this. Your marks will be allotted based upon the viva, as well as based on the reports submitted against each problem statement.
